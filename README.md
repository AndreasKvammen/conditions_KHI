# Conditions for the Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability in the Arctic Ionosphere

## Overview
This repository contains the data, source code, and supplementary materials for the research article titled
"Conditions for the Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability in the Arctic Ionosphere" by A. Kvammen, A. Spicher,
 M. D. Zettergren, Devin Huyghebaert, Theresa Rexer, Bj√∂rn Gustavsson, and Juha Vierinen.

The study investigates the formation and evolution of the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability under various
conditions in the Arctic ionosphere through plasma simulations.

## Repository Structure
movies/: This folder contains movies of the simulations illustrating the development of KHI under different
conditions. These movies are supplementary materials that visually demonstrate the findings discussed in
the article.

source/: This folder includes the source code and data necessary to reproduce the figures presented in the
article. The folder is further organized into subfolders corresponding to each figure.
- Figure1/: Contains the data and scripts to reproduce Figure 1 of the article.
- Figure2/: Contains the data and scripts to reproduce Figure 2 of the article.
- Figure3/: Contains the data and scripts to reproduce Figure 3 of the article.
- Figure4/: Contains the data and scripts to reproduce Figure 4 of the article.
- Figure5/: Contains the data and scripts to reproduce Figure 5 of the article.

## Getting Started
To reproduce the figures from the article, navigate to the appropriate subfolder in the source/ directory
and run the provided scripts using MATLAB.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have MATLAB 2022b installed. The scripts may also require additional MATLAB toolboxes or
functions.

## Running the Code
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
