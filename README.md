# Conditions for the Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability in the Polar Ionosphere

## Overview
This repository contains the data, source code, and supplementary materials for the research article titled
"Conditions for the Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability in the Polar Ionosphere" by Andreas Kvammen, Andres Spicher, Matthew Zettergren, Devin Huyghebaert, Theresa Rexer, Bj√∂rn Gustavsson, and Juha Vierinen.

The study investigates the formation and evolution of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) under various
conditions in the polar ionosphere through plasma simulations.

## Repository Structure
movies/: This folder contains movies of the simulations illustrating the development of KHI under different conditions. These movies are supplementary materials that visually demonstrate the findings discussed in the article.

data/: This folder contains the electron density simulation outputs at the F-region maximum (330 km altitude). The data is organized in subfolders according to the resolution:
- 250m_resolution/: Contains the simulation frames with 250 m horizontal resolution.
- 1000m_resoltion/: Contains the simulation frames with 1000 m horizontal resolution.
The naming of each file describes the initial conditions. For example, the file named "5Ne11_L06_V13.nc" contains the simulation frames initiated with:
  - 5Ne11 - electron density = 5*10e11
  - L06 - velocity shear width = 6 km
  - V13 - velocity shear strength = 1.3 km/s

source/: This folder includes the source code to reproduce the figures presented in the
article. The folder is further organized into subfolders corresponding to each figure.
- figure1/: Contains the data and scripts to reproduce Figure 1 of the article.
- figure2/: Contains the data and scripts to reproduce Figure 2 of the article.
- figure3/: Contains the data and scripts to reproduce Figure 3 of the article.
- figure4/: Contains the data and scripts to reproduce Figure 4 of the article.
- figure5/: Contains the data and scripts to reproduce Figure 5 of the article.
- initialize_250m_resolution/: Contains the code to initialize GEMINI with various initial conditions and 250 m horizontal resolution.
- initialize_1000m_resolution/: Contains the code to initialize GEMINI with various initial conditions and 1000 m horizontal resolution.
   
## Getting Started
To reproduce the figures from the article, navigate to the appropriate subfolder in the source/ directory and run the provided scripts using MATLAB.

To set up the GEMINI simulation, use: 

gemini3d.model.setup("config.nml","output directory name") 

where the config.nml is in the initialization folder (e.g. Ne11_L06_V13)

GEMINI can then be run in a command window using the command: mpiexec -np build/gemini.bin

for example: mpiexec -np 64 build/gemini.bin home/simulations/Ne11_L06_V13/

For more information on how to set up GEMINI, please visit: https://github.com/gemini3d

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have MATLAB 2022b installed. The scripts may also require additional MATLAB toolboxes or
functions.

## Running the Code
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/conditions_KHI.git

2. Navigate to the desired figure folder:
cd conditions_KHI/source/Figure1

3. Follow the instructions in the MATLAB script to run and generate the figure.
