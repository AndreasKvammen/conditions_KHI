# Conditions for the Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability in the Arctic Ionosphere

## Overview
This repository contains the data, source code, and supplementary materials for the research article titled
"Conditions for the Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability in the Polar Ionosphere" by Andreas Kvammen, Andres Spicher, Matthew Zettergren, Devin Huyghebaert, Theresa Rexer, Bj√∂rn Gustavsson, and Juha Vierinen.

The study investigates the formation and evolution of the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability under various
conditions in the Arctic ionosphere through plasma simulations.

## Repository Structure
movies/: This folder contains movies of the simulations illustrating the development of KHI under different
conditions. These movies are supplementary materials that visually demonstrate the findings discussed in
the article.

source/: This folder includes the source code and data necessary to reproduce the figures presented in the
article. The folder is further organized into subfolders corresponding to each figure.
- figure1/: Contains the data and scripts to reproduce Figure 1 of the article.
- figure2/: Contains the data and scripts to reproduce Figure 2 of the article.
- figure3/: Contains the data and scripts to reproduce Figure 3 of the article.
- figure4/: Contains the data and scripts to reproduce Figure 4 of the article.
- figure5/: Contains the data and scripts to reproduce Figure 5 of the article.
- initialize_250m_resolution/: Contains the code to initialize GEMINI with various initial conditions and 250 m horizontal resolution.
- initialize_1000m_resolution/: Contains the code to initialize GEMINI with various initial conditions and 1000 m horizontal resolution.
   
## Getting Started
To reproduce the figures from the article, navigate to the appropriate subfolder in the source/ directory
and run the provided scripts using MATLAB.

To set up the GEMINI simulation, use: gemini3d.model.setup("config.nml","output directory name") where the config.nml is in the initialization folder (e.g. Ne11_L06_V13)

GEMINI can then be run in a command window using the command: mpiexec -np build/gemini.bin

for example: mpiexec -np 64 build/gemini.bin home/simulations/Ne11_L06_V13/

For more information on how to set up GEMINI, please visit: https://github.com/gemini3d

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have MATLAB 2022b installed. The scripts may also require additional MATLAB toolboxes or
functions.

## Running the Code
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/conditions_KHI.git

3. Navigate to the desired figure folder:
cd conditions_KHI/source/Figure1

4. Follow the instructions in the MATLAB script to run and generate the figure.
